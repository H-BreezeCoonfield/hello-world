# hello-world
My first repository: a place for ideas and practice
## A little about myself
>I am an artist and aspring web developer. I don't really know what I am doing at this point but I am excited to learn. I am taking the coding dojo bootcamp to learn the Javascript and Python Stacks they offer. My name middle name is Breeze and thats what I go by. Maybe one day I'll reveal my first name. (probs not tho lol)
## Things I'm interested in doing
1. Anything spooky I would love to make an interactive story based on searching through a real website and its code to reveal it.
2. Learning a bit about coding for games 
3. Making my own portfolio site for art as a potential project
